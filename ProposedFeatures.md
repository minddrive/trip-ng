# Introduction #

Here is the current list of proposed features that will be considered for TRipNG.
List is subject to change.


# Details #

## Required ##

  * Ability to rip a CD and encode into multiple formats in a single run of the program
  * Option to retain lossless format files for future re-encoding; planned default is FLAC
  * Comprehensive tagging for all supported encoding formats, along with option to retain information for a given CD
  * Interactive editor to allow user to modify the tagging information to be written to the encoded files; this includes being able to combine multiple contiguous tracks into a single track and retain all information from the original individual tracks
  * Option to have normalization to even out volume levels of one's music collection to a desired level
  * Ability to easily re-tag previously encoded files with full flexibility

## Considered ##

  * Ability to encode into multiple formats simultaneously (useful on multi-core CPUs)
  * Ability to correct and continue from a run failure or abort
  * API to allow graphical interfaces to be easily constructed for users not comfortable with a command line
