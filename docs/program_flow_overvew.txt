The basic flow for the program will always begin with the following:

  - Do initial parsing of command line; if configuration file is
    found, ensure it exists and load in information
  - Finish parsing command line

For the normal flow of ripping and encoding a disc, the following occurs:

  - Ensure requested ripped and encoder (or encoders) exist
  - If '--retain-lossless' was set, check to see if flac encoder
    is available; if it is available add to encoder list
  - Ensure media device exists and scan CD info ID
  - Do a lookup in the data for CD info ID and retrieve information,
    else attempt to connect to remote CDDB server for information
  - Once CDDB lookup done (or times out - give reasonable time),
    start up an editor with information from database, CDDB
    or default text
  - After editing is complete, save information to database
    with CD info ID, then start ripper
  - As each track (or segue) is complete, run the track through
    the normalization program if '--normalize' option was given,
    then start encoding the new ripped file:
      - Ensure encoding hasn't already been performed (for example,
        using ripper options to output to FLAC and wanting to
        encode into the FLAC format)
  - Once encoding is complete for a given encoder, tag the new
    encoded files with the information from the editing session
    and rename file based on tag information
  - After all encoding is complete, remove original ripped files
    unless they are in the format used for '--retain-lossless'

[FUTURE] For encoding from lossless files, the following occurs:

  - If a CD info ID was given, look for it in the database
  - If no results are found, or ID wasn't given, attempt to
    retrieve data from lossless files themselves
  - Start up an editor with the information retrieved from the
    database or files
  - Ensure changes are valid (segues may not be created nor
    destroyed, and tracks must match number being re-encoded),
    then save information to database only if it was retrieved
    from there (under the CD info ID)
  - Encode each lossless file into the requested encoding formats
  - Once encoding is complete for a given encoder, tag the new
    encoded files with the information from the editing session
    and rename file based on tag information

[FUTURE] For re-tagging files, the following occurs:

  - TO BE FILLED IN LATER
