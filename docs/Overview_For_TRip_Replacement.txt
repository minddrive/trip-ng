TRip Replacement Overview
=========================

Reason for replacement:

    TRip has been sufficient in the past, but certain deficiencies have
    driven the need for a replacement, since the current TRip code is
    somewhat impenetrable and difficult to extend.  The need for a very
    flexible command line interface with unique capabilities that have
    not been found in any other current ripping/encoding applications
    out there have spurred the development of this new program.


Features of replacment:

  - Able to rip a CD and encode into multiple formats in a single run
    of the program.  (Required)

  - Able to encode into multiple formats simultaneously.  (Considered)

  - Able to retain lossless format files for future re-encoding;
    current planned format is FLAC.  (Required)

  - Comprehensive tagging within all different encode formats to retain
    information for a given CD.  (Required)

  - Interactive editor to allow user to modify the tagging information
    to be written to encoded files, including combining various conti-
    guous tracks into a single track while retaining all information
    from the original individual tracks.  (Required)

  - Able to restart from a program failure or abort.  (Considered)

  - API to allow graphical interfaces to be easily constructed for
    users who prefer not using a command line.  (Considered)

  - Normalization to even out volume levels of one's CD collection to
    a desired level.  (Required)

  - Fully configurable re-tagging of already encoded files.  (Required)


User interface:

  - Command line based.  User should have a lot of control via options
    as to what gets done and possibly even how it's done.

  - Configurable editor (vi or emacs to start with) for editing CDDB
    information.  Potentially some useful macros should be created for
    this to ease configuration (like joining multiple tracks into one)
    for the user.

  - Simple yet informative progress information.


Internals:

  - Modular design to allow full separation of the ripping and encoding
    processes, as well as handling different ripping and encoding soft-
    ware (initially cdda2wav and cdparanoia(?) for ripping; flactools,
    oggenc, and LAME for encoding).


Notes:

  - assume infinite disk space; don't want to play games with it, disk
    is cheap

  - potentially multiple tools to handle all capabilities

  - decide what order the various processes must happen in, which stages
    user input will be needed, what needs to be customizable and what
    doesn't

  - Format to use for combined tracks:

      SEGUE 7: A Flash Before My Eyes
      TRACK 1: The Ballet Of The Impact
      TRACK 2: I Wouldn't Let It Go
      TRACK 3: Surfing Down The Avalanche
      TRACK 4: She Is Everything
      TRACK 5: Climbing Up That Hill
      TRACK 6: Letting Go
      TRACK 7: Of The Beauty Of It All

    The SEGUE <num> means the next <num> tracks should be combined with
    the title given.  The track titles will be kept in a comments field
    (or as indexes, if the format has such a thing).
